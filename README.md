**Goal of the Project**

In this project, we built a system that provides users with information about roads in California and Nevada. Specifically, the implementation of the system consists of two parts. 

* __Backend:__ where we need developed algorithms that define the *functionalities of the system*
* __Frontend:__ where we provide *visualization for queries entered by the user*

 
 The repository contains:
 * ```functionality1.py```: A module that implements functions for *Functionality 1- Find the Neighbours!*
 * ```functionality2.py```: A module that implements functions for *Functionality 2- Find the Smartest Network!*
 * ```functionality3.py```: A module that implements functions for *Functionality 3 - Shortest Ordered Route!*
 * ```functionality4.py```: A module that implements functions for *Functionality 4 - Shortest Route!*
 * ```main.py```: a Python script which executes the whole system. It ask some inputs and provide the right outputs.
 * ```Notebooks```: A folder that containts notebooks for a direct visualization of how Functionalities work and their visualization
  * ```Figures```: A folder that contains some figures form the notebooks (those are html figures, connected to GoogleMaps or OpenStreeView)
